<blockquote><p><b>The planning, construction, and arrangement of farm buildings do not
usually receive the thought and study these subjects warrant. How many
dairymen have compared a circular, 40-cow barn with the common rectangular
building containing the same area? How many understand that
the circular structure is much the stronger; that the rectangular form requires
22 percent more wall and foundation to enclose the same space; and
that the cost of material is from 34 to 58 percent more for the rectangular
building?</b></p></blockquote>

<p>In a community in which everyone is engaged in the same occupation,
one person is likely to copy from his neighbor without
apparently giving a thought as to whether or not there is a better
way.</p>

<p>In a district of Kane county, Illinois, a certain type of dairy
barn is used by nearly everyone, while in the next county a distinctly
different type prevails, and the dairy barns of another adjacent
county differ from those of either of the former, simply
because the early settlers of this particular locality came from an
eastern state and started building the style of barn then common
in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In a certain community in Ohio where a milk condensing factory
is located, a large number of farmers have barns 36&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60 feet,
with an &#8220;L&#8221; the same size. The loft of the &#8220;L&#8221; is used for the
storage of straw, and the cows run loose in the lower portion.
These barns are all built on practically the same plan and are usually
of the same size, and this is the only community known to the
writer where this form of barn is used in this manner.</p>

<p>This tendency to imitate emphasizes the fact that men do not
exercise sufficient originality. Because most barns are rectangular
is no reason that this is the best and most economical form.</p>

<h3><a name="Sec_1" id="Sec_1"></a><span class="smcap">Why More Round Barns Are not Built</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<a id="F1" name="F1"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1. <span class="smcap">Barn No.</span> 5. <span class="smcap">100 feet in diameter, scale 20 feet to one inch; Showing
increased mow capacity given by self-supporting roof.</span></span>
</div>

<p>In an early day when lumber was cheap, buildings were built
of logs, or at least had heavy frames. Under these conditions, the
rectangular barn was the one naturally used, and people have followed
in the footsteps of their forefathers in continuing this form
of barn. The result is that the economy and advantages of the
round barn have apparently never been considered. This is because
they are not obvious at first sight, and become fully apparent
only after a detailed study of the construction. For these reasons,
the rectangular form still continues to be built, altho it re<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>quires
much more lumber. As the price of lumber has advanced so
materially in recent years, the possible saving in this material is a
large item, and well worth investigating.</p>

<p>The objections to round barns have usually been made by those
who have only a superficial knowledge of the subject, and do not
really understand the relative merits of the two forms. To the
writer's knowledge, there has never been published a carefully figured
out, detailed comparison of a properly constructed circular
barn with the rectangular barn.</p>

<p>The difficulty with most round barns that have been built, thus
far, is that they do not have a self-supporting roof, and consequently
lose many of the advantages of a properly constructed
round barn. This is the principal reason why round barns have
not become more popular. A straight roof necessarily requires
many supports in the barn below. These are both costly and inconvenient,
and make the roof no stronger than a dome-shaped,
self-supporting roof which nearly doubles the capacity of the mow.
See <a href="#F1">Fig. (1)</a>.</p>

<p>Many who have thus disregarded capacity have also wasted
lumber and made a needless amount of work by chopping or hewing
out the sill and plate, thus requiring more labor and lumber,
besides sacrificing the greater strength of a built-up sill. Rightly
constructed round barns are, however, being built to a limited extent.
One contractor has erected twenty-four round barns, with
self-supporting roofs, in the last nine years. These barns vary in
size from 40 feet in diameter with 18-foot posts to 102 feet in
diameter with 30-foot posts.</p>

<p>Another reason for the scarcity of round barns is the difficulty
in getting them built. Most carpenters hesitate to undertake the
work because in the erection of a round barn the construction
should be entirely different from that of the rectangular form.
Many new problems present themselves, but when these are once
understood, the round barn offers no more difficulties in construction
than the rectangular form. It is, however, important to have
a head carpenter who is accustomed to putting up round barns, as
a man with ingenuity and experience can take advantage of many
opportunities to save labor and material.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kind of Barn Needed</span></h3>

<p>The first thing to consider in the erection of a barn is a convenient
arrangement for the purpose for which it is to be used.
At the University of Illinois, two years ago, a twenty-acre demonstration
dairy farm was started, the sole object being to produce
the largest amount of milk per acre at the least possible cost. To<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
meet the requirements of a barn for this purpose, it became imperative
to build one that was convenient for feeding and caring
for the cows, economical of construction, and containing a large
storage capacity in both silo and mow. These are the requirements
of a barn for every practical dairyman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/fig_002.jpg" width="600" height="345" alt="" title="Fig. 2." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2. <span class="smcap">Filling the silo.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A silo was needed that could be fed from the year round. With
the small number of cows kept, a deep enough layer of silage could
not be fed off each day to keep it good thru the summer, if the
silo was more than 12 feet in diameter. As this small diameter
was a necessity, it would require two silos 33 feet deep to supply
enough silage. Two silos of such small diameter would not only
be costly, but difficult to make stand, unless built of concrete. This
difficulty was overcome by using the circular barn and placing in
the center a silo which is 12 feet in diameter and 54 feet deep, thus
making the one silo, with as much capacity as the two before mentioned,
answer every purpose. This deep silo is an important part
of the round barn, as it not only forms a support for the roof, but
is protected by the barn, thus saving the cost of siding. Then,
too, besides occupying the space least valuable for other purposes,
it being centrally located, is in the most convenient place for feeding.
The silage chute being open at the top forms a suction of air,
which keeps the silage odor from the barn at milking time, and
also assists in ventilation when the door to the chute is open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span></p>
<h2><a name="Sec_2" id="Sec_2"></a>ADVANTAGES OF THE ROUND BARN</h2>

<blockquote><p><b>The points of superiority that the round dairy barn shows over the rectangular
form are convenience, strength, and cheapness.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Round Barn Most Convenient</span></h3>

<p>Considering that the barn on a dairy farm is used twice every
day in the year, and that for six months each year the cows occupy
it almost continuously, and that during this time a large
amount of the labor of the farm is done inside the barn, it is evident
that the question of its convenience is a vital one. The
amount of time and strength wasted in useless labor in poorly arranged
buildings is appalling. People do not stop to consider the
saving in a year or a lifetime by having the barn so conveniently
arranged that there is a saving of only a few seconds on each task
that has to be done two or three times every day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/fig_003.jpg" width="600" height="430" alt="" title="Fig. 3." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3. <span class="smcap">Interior of barn, second floor, showing silo and location
of ensilage cutter.</span> (<span class="smcap">team unhitched to show cutter.</span>)</span>
</div>

<p>The round barn has a special advantage in the work of distributing
silage to the cows. The feeding commences at the chute
where it is thrown down, and is continued around the circle, ending
with the silage cart at the chute again, ready for the next feeding.
The same thing is true in feeding hay and grain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>Still another great advantage is the large unobstructed hay
mow. With the self-supporting roof, there are no timbers whatever
obstructing the mow, which means no dragging of hay around
posts or over girders. The hay carrier runs on a circular track
around the mow, midway between the silo and the outside wall,
and drops the hay at any desired point, thus in no case does the
hay have to be moved but a few feet, which means a saving of
much labor in the mowing.</p>

<p>To successfully embody all of the above discussed advantages
in a dairy barn is one of the large problems in milk production.
In a careful study of the barn question it soon became apparent
that it was impossible to embody all of the requirements advantageously
in anything but a circular form of building, and the 60-foot
round barn, which is here described, was built.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4. <span class="smcap">South view, showing well lighted stable.</span></span>
</div>

<h3><a name="Sec_3" id="Sec_3"></a><span class="smcap">Circular Construction the Strongest</span></h3>

<p>The circular construction is the strongest, because it takes advantage
of the lineal, instead of the breaking strength of the lumber.
Each row of boards running around the barn forms a hoop
that holds the barn together. A barrel, properly hooped and
headed, is almost indestructible, and much stronger than a box,
altho the hoops are small. This strength is because the stress
comes on the hoops in a lineal direction. Any piece of timber is
many times stronger on a lineal pull than on a breaking stress.
Take for example a No. 1 yellow pine 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6, 16 feet long, with an<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>
actual cross section of 1<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inches. If placed on edge and
supported at the ends, as a joist, the limit of safety for a load
evenly distributed is 642 pounds, while the limit of safety for a
load in the lineal direction of the same piece of timber is 12,800
pounds, or twenty times as great.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/fig_005.jpg" width="600" height="379" alt="" title="Fig. 5." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5. <span class="smcap">In cow stable, showing silo and feed alley in center of
barn; Stanchions on right, milk scales and record sheet on left.</span></span>
</div>

<p>All exposed surfaces of a round barn are circular, as both the
sides and roof are arched, which is the strongest form of construction
to resist wind pressure; besides, the wind, in striking it,
glances off and can get no direct hold on the walls or roof, as it
can on the flat sides or gable ends of a rectangular structure. If
the lumber is properly placed in a round barn, much of it will perform
two or more functions. Every row of siding boards running
around the building serves also as a brace, and the same is true of
the roof boards and the arched rafters. If the siding is put on
vertically and the roof built dome-shaped, no scaffolding is required
inside or out. These are points of economy in the round construction.</p>

<h3><a id="Sec_4" name="Sec_4"></a><span class="smcap">Rectangular Barns Require 34 to 58 Percent More
Material</span></h3>

<p>In order to compare the amount and cost of material in round
and rectangular barns, the following figures have been carefully
worked out by an expert barn builder. Two comparisons, based<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>
on wood construction thruout, are
made, in which round barns 60
feet and 90 feet in diameter are
compared with both plank and
mortise frame rectangular barns
containing the same number of
square feet of floor space, respectively.
Since the most practical
width of a rectangular dairy
barn is 36 feet, its length will depend
upon the number of square
feet required in the barn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7. <span class="smcap">Showing construction of plank frame barn, side view.</span></span>
</div>

<p><a href="#F6">Figures 6</a> to <a href="#F9">9</a> are side and
end views, showing the detail
construction and size of the timbers
of the plank frame and mortise
frame barns here figured.
The detailed figures of the lumber
bills for each of these barns
were carefully worked out, but
are too voluminous for publication here. The total number of feet
of each kind of lumber required is given in <a href="#T1a">Tables 1A</a> and <a href="#T1b">1B</a>.
Since the proportion of the different kinds of lumber and shingles
varied for the different barns, to draw an exact comparison it was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
necessary to base it upon the
money value, and for this purpose
the total cost of lumber has been
figured in each case. The lumber
values used thruout are the best
average prices that could be obtained.
As the same prices are
used for the material of all the
barns, the comparisons of cost are
correct, altho these exact prices
will not hold for all localities and
all times.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/fig_008.png" width="446" height="550" alt="" title="Fig. 8." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8. <span class="smcap">Showing construction of
plank frame barn, end view.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Since a silo cannot be
economically built inside of a
rectangular barn, the first comparison
is made with the barns
simply enclosed, altho one of the
chief advantages of a round barn
is the deep silo which it is possible
to build so economically in the center.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="F9" name="F9"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9. <span class="smcap">Showing construction of mortise frame barn, side view.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Another item of economy in the circular barn is less framing
lumber. This form has the strongest possible construction with
the least lumber in the frame, and the least bracing, not a single<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
timber larger than a 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6 being required above the sill. The arched
circular roof requires no supports, and no scaffolding is needed
inside during its construction.</p>

<p>The accompanying tables show the comparative amount and
value of lumber and cubical content in round barns 60 and 90 feet
in diameter, and rectangular barns of equal area and height of posts.</p>

<h3><a id="Sec_5" name="Sec_5"></a><span class="smcap">Round and Rectangular Barns Compared</span></h3>

<p>In comparing the 60-foot round barn with a rectangular barn
of the same area, the two barns should afford the cows the same
amount of space on the platform. Allowing each cow in the 60-foot
round barn 3 feet 6 inches in width at the rear of the platform,
it will accommodate 40 cows and leave space for two passage
ways. But in a rectangular barn, only 3 feet 4 inches of platform
space need be allowed for each cow, and the 78<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> foot barn, with
two 3-foot passage ways across it for convenience in feeding, will
accommodate 42 cows. While the rectangular barn has stall room
for two more cows, the round barn contains space in the center for
a silo 18 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The floor space and cubical content of the round barn 60 feet
in diameter, and the rectangular barn compared with it in these
tables, are practically the same, and the barns are therefore directly
comparable. This being true, the percentages which were
figured from the complete bills of material for these barns show
the exact saving in lumber on the 60-foot round barn over the
plank and mortise frame rectangular barns 36&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;78<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet. The
lumber bills of the rectangular barns show an increase in cost of
28 percent for the plank frame and 54 percent for the mortise
frame. The round barn, 60 feet in diameter, contains 188<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, and
the rectangular barn 225 lineal feet of wall. The rectangular barn
has, therefore, 22 percent more lineal feet of outside barn wall,
requiring a proportional increase in both paint and foundation.</p>

<p>The 176<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-foot rectangular barn would hold 100 cows, allowing
each cow 3 feet 4 inches in width and providing for 3 passage
ways of 3 feet each across the barn.</p>

<p>The 90-foot round barn would hold 100 cows in two rows
headed together, 65 of which would be in the outer circle, and have
3 feet 6 inches each in width at the gutter. This leaves sufficient
room for feed alleys and walks, and two passage ways, one three
feet and the other seven feet wide for the manure and feed carriers.
All of this is outside of a central space for a silo 20 feet
in diameter and 71 feet high, with a capacity for 620 tons of silage,
and in the mow there would still be an excess, above the capacity
of the rectangular barn, of 33,000 cubic feet, which would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12" name="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a><br />[Pg 13]</span> hold 66 tons of hay, or as much as the entire mow of a barn 32&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;36
feet with 20-foot posts.</p>

<p>The square feet of floor space in the round barn 90 feet in diameter
and rectangular barn 36&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;176<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> feet are the same, but the
cubical content of the former is more than that of the latter. The
increase in the lumber bill is 23 percent in the plank frame and 53
percent in the mortise frame barn. The round barn 90 feet in
diameter contains 283 and the rectangular barn 426 lineal feet of
wall. The rectangular barn has, therefore, 50 percent more lineal
feet of outside barn wall, requiring a proportional increase in both
paint and foundation.</p>

<p>The smaller surface on the outside wall of the round barn requires
less paint and makes a proportional saving in keeping the
round barn painted in after years.</p>

<h3><a id="Sec_6" name="Sec_6"></a><span class="smcap">Round and Rectangular Barns</span>, <i>Including Silos</i>, <span class="smcap">Compared</span></h3>

<p>Owing to the fact that a silo is a necessity for the most economical
production of milk, a barn is not complete for a dairyman's
purpose unless it includes a silo with capacity to store sufficient
silage for the herd. In the case of the round barn, the silo is most
economically built inside, but in the rectangular form would cause
a waste of space, and for that reason is best erected outside. Therefore,
in comparing a round dairy barn with a rectangular dairy
barn, silos should be included.</p>

<p>In figuring the cost of materials in the silos for the round and
rectangular barns, the capacity needed in each case was determined
in the following manner: Allowing 40 pounds of silage per cow
per day for 7 winter months and 25 pounds per cow per day for
3 months during the summer, would require for 40 cows
220 tons; then allowing one-eighth for waste would make the silage
requirement 248 tons. As the silo in the round barn 60 feet
in diameter is 53 feet deep, it would need to be only 16 feet in diameter
to hold 250 tons. This diameter is sufficiently small to allow
summer feeding without waste. To erect a silo outside of a
barn, with sufficient stability to stand well, the height above ground
should not be much more than twice the diameter, and in order to
avoid waste for summer feeding, the diameter should not be
greater than 16 feet for a herd of 40 cows. In order that a deep
enough layer of silage can be fed off each day during the summer
to avoid waste, it is evident that to store 250 tons of silage outside
the barn, two silos would be required. One of these should be 16
feet in diameter and 36 feet deep, holding 154 tons, and the other
13 feet in diameter and 36 feet deep, holding 102 tons, making a
total silo capacity of 256 tons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>As the large barns hold 100 cows, the same allowance of silage
per cow for the season would require silo capacity for 620 tons.
As the silo in the round barn 90 feet in diameter would be 71 feet
deep, it would need to be only 20 feet in diameter to hold 620 tons.
To store 620 tons of silage in silos built outside the rectangular
barn would require two silos, each 20 feet in diameter and 44 feet
deep.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> These are the sizes on which the figures for cost of silos
of the Gurler type, given in <a href="#T2a">Tables 2A</a> and <a href="#T2b">2B</a>, were used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

valve, salt box, and door into dairy.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The table (<a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>) is the final summing up of the cost of all
the material for the completed dairy barns, with silos, and shows a
saving of from 34 to 58 percent in favor of the round barn and
silo, or an actual money saving in this case of from $379 to $1184,
depending upon the size and construction of the barns.</p>

<p>Thoughtlessly, men go on building rectangular barns, but what
would this reckless disregard of a possible saving of 34 to 58 percent
mean in a year's business on the farm? Some illustrations
may help us to understand what this money saved in building a
round barn really amounts to, and its convenience is also a great
saving. If the dairyman discarded the idea of a rectangular barn
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>and built a round barn instead, he could take the money thus saved
and buy one of the best pure-bred sires for his herd, and also three
to ten pure-bred heifers or fine grade cows. Either of these purchases
might double the profit of the herd. Or, this saving, properly
applied, would purchase many labor-saving devices which
would make life less of a drudgery on many dairy farms. Is not
such a saving worth while?</p>

</div>

<p>When the comparative cost and merit of two constructions are
known, it is a poor financier who will pay extra for the one which
is inferior. If a man received bids from contractors for a building,
he would be a foolish man who would accept one which is
from 34 to 58 percent higher than the lowest bidder, especially
when he knew the lowest bidder would put up the most convenient
and substantial building.</p>

<h2>DISADVANTAGES OF THE ROUND DAIRY BARN</h2>


<p>The disadvantages of the round dairy barn are, that it cannot
be enlarged by building on as readily as can the rectangular form,
but as the round barn may be built higher to the eaves than a rectangular
barn 36 feet wide, provision can be made for the growth
of the herd by building so as to put cows in the second story and
still leave sufficient mow room for hay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>The objection is frequently raised that a round barn is difficult
to light. This difficulty is entirely overcome in a barn 90 feet or
less in diameter, if a sufficient number of properly spaced windows
are used. See <a href="#F4">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#F30">30</a>. With the same number of windows,
the light is more evenly distributed in a round barn and the
sun can shine directly into some portion at all hours of the day
during the winter.</p>

</div>

<p>The objection has been raised that rectangular objects cannot
be placed in a circle without a waste of space, but this does not
apply to a dairy barn, as the storage of hay and grain depends upon
cubical content, alone, and silos should always be circular, no matter
where built. Cows, when lying down, are decidedly wedge-shaped,
requiring much less space in front than behind. The objection
may be raised, with round barns large enough for two rows
of cows, that the row headed out does not use the space as economically
as in the rectangular form, because a cow needs more
width at the rear of the platform than at the manger. Where
there are two rows of cows, the inner row is usually headed out,
and as only about one-third of the cows are in this row, this loss
of space is counterbalanced by the large number of cows in the
outer circle using the space more economically than they do in the
rectangular barn.</p>

<p>Box stalls cannot be as conveniently arranged, but in a one-row
barn, gates hung on the outside and swung around to the manger,
form stalls for cows at freshening time, and in a barn with two
rows, box stalls can be arranged in the inner circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span></p>
<h2><a name="Sec_7" id="Sec_7"></a>HOW THE ROUND BARN AT THE UNIVERSITY WAS
BUILT</h2>

<p>The barn is located on the side of a hill, sloping gently to the
south and east. With this location, it was an advantage to excavate
5 feet deep on the northwest and run out to the surface of
the ground on the southeast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="F13" name="F13"></a>
<img src="images/fig_013.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="" title="Fig. 13." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13. <span class="smcap">Showing temporary bracing to hold studs in place while
ship lap ceiling is nailed on.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The footing for the foundation is 18 inches wide. A ten-inch
brick wall was carried up nine feet above the stable floor. This
wall contains a 2-inch air space to prevent moisture from condensing
on the inner wall and making the barn damp. This is an important
point, as barns with a solid stone or brick wall are very
objectionable on account of dampness. It has been proven by two
years' use that this difficulty is entirely obviated by the air space
in the wall.</p>

<p>The foundation for the manger and feed alley is built up 2 feet
above the stable floor. The foundation for the silo extends 4 feet
below the stable floor and is continued 9 inches above the floor in
the feed alley. This silo wall, together with the foundation under
the manger, forms the foundation for the center supports of the
barn. <a href="#F12">Fig. 12</a> shows the foundation completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>The silo, which is the Gurler type, was then started and carried
up with the barn. It was built by placing 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4 studs around the
circle, one foot on centers, and ceiling inside with <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6-inch lumber.
This <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch lumber was obtained by re-sawing 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6 yellow
pine fencing. Common lath were then put on horizontally in the
regular way inside, without furring out, and plastered with rich
cement plaster.</p>

<p>The sill of the barn is 6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6, made up of 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6s, and built on top
of the wall. Building it up in this manner makes a stronger sill
than can be obtained in any other way, as it forms a continuous
hoop around the barn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 14. <span class="smcap">Showing height and construction of silo, siding completed,

</div>

<p>The joists are 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;12s notched 6 inches to fit the sill, so that the
outer ends rest on both the sill and the brick wall. The outer span
of joists is 14 feet and the inner ends of these joists rest on a
similar sill built of 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6s on top of the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4 supports at the stanchions.
The inner span of joists, between the stanchions and the
silo, is 8 feet, the outer end resting on the sill over the
stanchions, and the inner end on a 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6-inch band, made up<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
of three <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6-inch pieces, running around the outside of the silo.
These joists are placed 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet apart at the outside of the barn,
and half as many joists are used in the inner span, making the
joists at the silo one foot apart. The number of joists under the
driveways are doubled, being only 1 foot and 3 inches apart at the
outside of the barn.</p>

</div>

<p>The studs, which are 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6s, 20 feet long, were then placed on the
sill, about 2 feet 6 inches apart, being as evenly spaced between
the windows as possible, and temporarily braced, as shown in <a href="#F13">Fig.
13</a>, until the 8-inch ship lap ceiling could be nailed on the outside.
This was carried up 5 feet to the second scaffold, and then covered
to this height with shingles laid 5 inches to the weather. The
scaffolding was then moved up and this process repeated until the
siding was completed. The plate, made up of five 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4s, was then
built in the notch in the top of the studs shown in <a href="#F13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>The silo was completed, as before described. The rafters,
which were framed on the ground, were then erected, as shown in
<a href="#F14">Fig. 14</a>, the first eight going to the center of the roof, and the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]<br />[Pg 21]</span>remaining ones were cut to rest on the plate of the silo. There are
64 framed rafters, and these are the only ones in the upper section
of the roof. At the break in the roof, a header is cut in between
the framed rafters, and in the lower section a rafter is placed between
these, thus making twice as many rafters in the lower section
of the roof as in the upper section. After the rafters were all
in place and temporarily braced, the 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2-inch sheathing was put
on, as shown in <a href="#F15">Fig. 15</a>, and the shingles, which were the best 5&#8260;2
red cedar, were laid 5 inches to the weather on the lower section
of the roof, and 4 inches to the weather on the upper section, as
this had less pitch. No chalk line was necessary, as the shingles
were laid by the sheathing.</p>

<p>Running cows loose in this manner is an excellent method,
where bedding is abundant and sufficient space is available, as the
cows are more comfortable, and all fertility is saved. There is no
waste from leaching, as when the manure lies exposed to the
weather. This method saves the labor of cleaning the stable, as
the manure is loaded into the spreader and hauled directly upon
the land whenever convenient, and the land is in the best condition
to receive it.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Three gates are hung on posts at the outside wall, and when
box stalls are needed, these are swung around to the manger, as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>shown in <a href="#F18">Fig. 18</a>. The south door in the cow stable can be closed
by slatted gates, thus affording an abundance of fresh air and sunshine
on nice days, without letting the cows out of the barn.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> For a more detailed discussion of the advantages of keeping cows in this manner, see

<h3><span class="smcap">System of Ventilation</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/fig_021b.jpg" width="600" height="443" alt="" title="Fig. 21 continuted." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 21. <span class="smcap">Continued.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The system of ventilation is the "King." To economize space
and lumber, the hay chute is used for a ventilator. This chute,
which extends to the cupola, is 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet, having a cross section
area of 8 sq. ft., which, with a good draft, is sufficient for
40 cows. In order that this combination of ventilator and hay
chute prove practical, doors thru which the hay could be thrust
were placed at intervals in the side of the chute. These doors are
hinged at the top, opening in, and close immediately after the hay
drops, thus maintaining a closed ventilator chute. The air is drawn
in at the bottom, the amount being regulated by means of a sliding
door in the side. As this chute is 50 feet high, it creates a strong
suction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Milk Room</span></h3>

<p>To economize space, the milk room, 12&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;16 feet, is located under
the north driveway. The brick walls under the drive form the
sides of this room, and the floor of the drive, which is made of
2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6s grooved on both edges, forms the roof. The grooves in the
flooring were filled with white lead, and a wooden strip, fitted to
fill the grooves of both planks, was driven in, forming a water-tight
floor. This floor was covered with hot tar and sand <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch
thick. The milk room is plastered on the inside, the plaster being
applied directly to the brick walls, excepting in the case of the ceiling,
which is lathed. The floor and cooling tank are of cement.
The passage from the barn to the milk room is thru a small hallway,
which is open to the outside, thus preventing the stable air
getting into the milk room.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 22. <span class="smcap">Feed alley, showing combined hay chute and ventilator.
A door on the side which is hinged at the bottom, 3 feet from
the floor, is let in toward the silo, sliding the hay onto the
floor. In hot weather this opening takes the heat out of the
barn; During the winter this door is kept closed and the ventilation
is regulated by raising the slide, as shown in the cut.</span></span>

<h3><span class="smcap">Re-arrangement of Barn to Accommodate</span> 40 <span class="smcap">Cows</span></h3>

<p>If it is desired to keep cows in stalls in a round barn of this
size, the circular manger can be enlarged to 38 feet in diameter,
which gives room for forty cows, as shown in <a href="#F25">Fig. 25</a>, and the silo,
to hold sufficient silage to feed the year round, enlarged to 18 feet
in diameter. The present mow room is sufficient to store enough
hay and bedding for this number of cows.</p>

<p>The barn on the Twenty-acre Demonstration Dairy Farm was
built this large, as it was thought it might be desired at some future
time to increase the size of the farm and herd, and the barn
could easily be changed to accommodate a larger herd by simply
enlarging the silo, without rebuilding the barn.</p>

feed alley and a 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-foot manger, the circle at the stanchions
would be 38 feet in diameter, or 119<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> feet in circumference;
Allowing 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> feet for two passage ways, the stalls would be 2 feet

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>The cost of this barn, if built on the ordinary dairy farm, could
be materially reduced without shortening the life of the barn.
Owing to the conditions under which this barn was built, it was
necessary to pay for hauling all material to the farm, two and one-half
miles from town. All of the labor had to be hired, and as it
was necessary for the men to board themselves the wages paid
were proportionately higher. The farmer usually does the excavating
and hauls the brick, sand, and lumber with his own teams,
tends the mason, and does quite an amount of the rough work
with his own help, besides boarding the men, all of which would
greatly reduce the cost. The construction could also be cheapened
by using drop siding to cover the outside, instead of shingles, which
in this case were used over ship lap on the side walls to improve
the appearance. This barn could be still further cheapened by putting
hoops, five feet apart, around the studs, and covering with
common 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;12 boards, put on vertically, as is done in some cases.
A saving could also be made on the mill work and large doors by<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
having the carpenters make these plainer and leave the windows
out of them.</p>

<p>Anyone wishing to build a round barn can get local bids on
the lumber bill, and determine approximately the cost in his locality.
This will vary with both the location and the year.</p>

<p>Remarks: Considering its size, the construction of this barn is
apparently too light to be substantial, as the joists and studs are
too small and too far apart, yet it has stood for nine years with
no more evidence of wear than is common with any barn.</p>

<p>Were the owner to build again he would place the studs only
2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet apart and use 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;12 joists, 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet apart at the outside
wall. He would also use cement plaster on inside of silo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37" name="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>The owner says it would have cost him as much to have built
a rectangular barn without the 500-ton silo, and containing 1300
sq. ft. less floor space. In other words, he gained a 500-ton silo
and 1300 sq. ft. of floor space, besides an immense amount of mow
room, by building a circular barn.</p>

<p>The round barns previously described do not meet the needs
of the man with only a few cows. He usually wants a general-purpose
barn. The circular form can be made satisfactory for this<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
purpose if proper attention is given to the plan. It is necessary
that the cow stable be distinctly separated from all other stock by
a tight wall. Round barns with this arrangement are giving satisfaction
in Illinois at the present time.</p>

<h2>DISADVANTAGES OF THE POLYGONAL BARN.</h2>

<p>A polygonal barn has the disadvantages of both the rectangular
and the round barn, and is less stable than either. It must
necessarily have a heavy frame, which is expensive, and as the siding
cannot run around the corners, it is very difficult to tie the different
sides together sufficiently to prevent the barn being racked
by the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span></p>
<h2><a name="Sec_10" id="Sec_10"></a>CONCLUSIONS</h2>

<p>In summing up the data given in this bulletin, it is obvious that
the advantages of the round barn are convenience, strength, and
cheapness.</p>

<p>The round barn is the more convenient, because of the unobstructed
mow, which reduces the labor required in mowing hay, and
because of the greater ease and fewer steps with which the feed
can be gotten to the cows, owing to the central location of the
supply.</p>

<p>The circular construction is the strongest because advantage is
taken of the lineal strength of the lumber. All exposed surfaces
are circular, and withstand greater wind pressure, as the wind can
get no direct hold, as on the sides or gable ends of a rectangular
barn.</p>

<p>In round numbers, rectangular barns require, according to their
construction, from 34 to 58 percent more in cost of material than
round barns with the same floor area and built of the same grade
of material.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
